            <div class="faq-list">
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3 class="faq-question">What agents does it work with?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer">Any coding agent that supports MCP: Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, and any VS Code agent extensions.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3 class="faq-question">How do I customize it for my product?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer">Design Rails references asks your coding agent to generate a summary of your styles and product based on the code. Your agent creates markdown files that Design Rails uses as context. Everything lives in version-controlled files you can update anytime.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3 class="faq-question">Can I add my own UX patterns?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer">Absolutely. The pattern library is extensible. Add internal patterns your team has developed alongside the universal library.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3 class="faq-question">What if my design system changes?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer">Update your design system config and all future generations immediately reflect the changes. No retraining required.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3 class="faq-question">How detailed are the design specs?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer">Extremely. Layout structure, component choices, spacing, typography, responsive breakpoints, interactive states, error handling, loading states, empty states, accessibility considerations—everything needed for implementation.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3 class="faq-question">Does this replace designers?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer">Design Rails amplifies designers, not replaces them. Think of it as scaling their expertise across your entire engineering team. Designers define the system, patterns, and standards once—Design Rails ensures those decisions get applied correctly every time code is written. This frees designers to work on what humans do best: solving novel UX problems, conducting research, and evolving your design language. Meanwhile, AI handles what AI does best: applying known patterns consistently at scale.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3 class="faq-question">Is this open source?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer">You own the markdown files with context of your product, and the design specs that are generated on your behalf. The design spec generator sits behind an MCP and is closed-source.</p>
